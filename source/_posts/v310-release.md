Hi folks. We've released new 3.1 version with a lot of improvements. If someone
of you hasn't updated your code to v3, fill free to do it with v3.1.
To make live easier we have [Marionette Patch Tool](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette-v3-compat)
for you.

So. What was changed?
Main thing in this release was increasing performance.
Thanks to [@rafde](https://github.com/rafde) for helping with that.
